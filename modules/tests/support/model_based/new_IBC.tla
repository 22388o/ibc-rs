VARIABLES
    \* This is only ever intended to have one header in it.
    \* The set is being used as sort of an Option type.

    chains,

(*

PLAN:
    - For every step, choose a chain to run a method on and advance by one block
    - The chain will advance whether or not the method has errored
    - If the method produces a message for the other chain, add it to messages set
    - If the method can only be triggered in response to a message from the other chain, run it with a message from the messages set
    - Find some way to inject invalid and out of order messages without trying every possible combination of messages
